How to Make Cheesecake:
Cheesecake Prep: Preheat the oven so it’s ready for you. Be sure to preheat at least 20 minutes before you plan on baking. This gives the oven plenty of time to reach the proper oven temperature. Prep you baking pan by wrapping it with aluminum foil and spraying it with nonstick baking spray.
Bake the Crust: The crust is partially baked before adding the batter to ensure it bakes up crispy. Let the crust cool as you make the batter.
Make the Cheesecake Batter: You’ll need a food processor, a stand mixer, or a large bowl and a handheld electric mixer to make the batter. Be sure to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl to eliminate any lumps hiding in the batter.
Pour the Batter: Slowly pour the cheesecake batter on top of the crust. Then smooth the top.
Water Bath: Place the cheesecake pan inside a large roasting pan and fill with hot water.
Bake the Cheesecake: Bake until the cheesecake is firm, but the center is just a little wiggly. Don’t over bake, it’ll firm up a good amount as the cheesecake cools.
Cool: Turn the oven off and let the cheesecake cool inside for 45 minutes before opening the oven door! This is by far the hardest part of baking a cheesecake! But be patient and let it chill at least 6 hours! You’ll be rewarded for your patience.
Slice and Serve: The best way to get clean slices? Use a very sharp knife, and wipe it between slices. Wrap any leftovers tightly in plastic wrap and store in the fridge for up to 3 days.
